# CPU Usage Optimization

## Problem
The application was experiencing high CPU usage (90-100%) on Render.com, causing pipeline usage alerts. The logs showed consistent high CPU warnings throughout the day.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Frequent CPU monitoring**: `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=0.1)` was called every 5 minutes
2. **Background monitoring thread**: Running every minute with system health checks
3. **Keep-alive service**: Making HTTP requests every 10 minutes during business hours
4. **Redis connection attempts**: Monitoring tried to connect to Redis for rate limiting stats

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Monitoring System (`app/monitoring.py`)

**Before:**
- Health checks every 5 minutes
- Background monitoring every 1 minute
- CPU checks with 0.1s interval
- No CPU throttling

**After:**
- Health checks every 15 minutes (3x reduction)
- Background monitoring every 5 minutes (5x reduction)
- CPU checks every 30 minutes with 1.0s interval (more accurate, less frequent)
- CPU throttling: Skip monitoring when CPU > 70%
- Cleanup every 10 minutes (2x reduction)

### 2. Keep-Alive Service (`main.py`)

**Before:**
- Business hours: 10-minute intervals
- Off-hours: 30-minute intervals
- 5-second timeout
- Basic error handling

**After:**
- Business hours: 15-minute intervals (50% reduction)
- Off-hours: 1-hour intervals (100% reduction)
- 3-second timeout
- Specific exception handling for timeouts and connection errors

### 3. CPU Usage Throttling

- When CPU usage exceeds 70%, monitoring activities are skipped
- Prevents monitoring from contributing to high CPU usage
- Automatic recovery when CPU usage normalizes

### 4. Redis Connection Optimization

- Added proper type checking for Redis responses
- Reduced connection timeouts
- Better error handling to prevent connection loops

## Expected Results

1. **Reduced CPU Usage**: 60-80% reduction in monitoring overhead
2. **Fewer Pipeline Alerts**: Less frequent high CPU warnings
3. **Better Resource Management**: More efficient use of Render.com resources
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All monitoring features still work, just less frequently

## Monitoring

Use the `scripts/cpu_monitor.py` script to track CPU usage improvements:

```bash
python scripts/cpu_monitor.py
```

## Deployment

These changes are ready for deployment. The optimizations are backward-compatible and will automatically reduce CPU usage without requiring any configuration changes.

## Future Considerations

1. **Adaptive Monitoring**: Consider implementing adaptive intervals based on actual usage patterns
2. **Metrics Dashboard**: Add a simple dashboard to visualize CPU usage trends
3. **Alert Thresholds**: Adjust alert thresholds based on new baseline performance
