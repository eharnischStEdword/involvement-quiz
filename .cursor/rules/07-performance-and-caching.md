# Performance & Caching

- Cache expensive computations with Flask-Caching and set sensible expirations.
- Optimize database queries; use indexing and avoid N+1 patterns.
- Reuse pooled connections and close them quickly.
- Offload heavy work to background tasks (e.g., Celery or scripts).
- Avoid redundant computation and prefer iteration over duplication.
