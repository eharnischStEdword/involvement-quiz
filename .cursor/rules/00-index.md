# Cursor Rules Index

These rules are **authoritative** for this repo. Prefer functional Python, Flask app-factory + blueprints, strict validation, early-returns, and small, testable units. Do not introduce new stacks without explicit instruction.

**Project map (from README)**:
- `app/` (app factory, config, database pool, cache, monitoring, auth, models, validators, utils, blueprints/*)  
- `scripts/` (monitoring utilities)  
- `templates/`, `static/`, `sw.js` (PWA)  
- Deployment: Render.com; production env vars required.  [oai_citation:1â€¡GitHub](https://github.com/eharnischStEdword/involvement-quiz)

- Always prefer small diffs; never broaden route behavior without tests.
- App factory is authoritative; blueprints live under app/blueprints/*.py and contain only routing wiring.
- Use guard clauses, early returns; avoid else-after-return; type-hint all public fns.
- Never introduce user PII fields; validators must reject unknown fields.
